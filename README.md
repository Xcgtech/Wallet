What is Xchange?
----------------

Xchange is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Xchange uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Xchange Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Xchange Core software, see https://www.xcgtech.comm

Development
-----------

Development for XCG - Xchange, specifically the Qt client, is done on a private branch and
only the core functionality required for network sync is pushed to this open-source repository.

GUI clients built from this repository will not have the escrow, auction, and other functionalities.
